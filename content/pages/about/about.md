## Myself

The Sorcerer’s Apprentice aka Software Craftsmanship Journeyman with experience in various industries and roles. I am enthusiast and evangelist of good engineering practices and Agile management.

I strongly believe in Software [Craftsmanship movement](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/). I am trying to spread my knowledge and passion to others.
That’s the reason why I am actively involved in many activities conducted by [Fundacja Gra o Sens](https://graosens.org.pl) like [School of Agile](https://szkolaagile.graosens.org.pl) and [Poradnia Lidera](https://graosens.org.pl/poradnialidera) and as well regular participant in various meetups and conferences.

My free-time is taken by wife, 2 daugthers, board games, miniature paiting, crafting dioramas.

If you want to know me feel free to reach me out on Twitter at [@MaciejTrojniarz](https://twitter.com/MaciejTrojniarz) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciejtrojniarz/).
