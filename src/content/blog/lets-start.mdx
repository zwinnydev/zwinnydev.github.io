## Hello World

### Why I'm writing blog

I've recently came across idea to start writing my thoughts for myself and as well for others.
Sometimes I'm solving some challanges that I couldn't find easy and clearly described solutions.
In other ocassions I came across interesting video, book, blog post, library or technology that I feel that it's worth sharing or at least dump my opinions about for my future self or for others.
I'm not promising that I will be writing regularly but well I'm doing that for myself. If you would find this interesting, entertaining or just you will learn somethings that's a bonus.

### What can you find here

I will be definietly writing about:

- Agile (as even the name of the blog suggest `Zwinny` means `Agile` in Polish)
- Software Craftsmanship
- Thoughts about various talks from conferences
- Thoughts that I've had after reading books or blog posts
- Findings about cool libraries and technologies
