I will have a privilidge to be a **host** of the next techBytes meetup. So there will ocassion to catch up and talk during the breaks or [Networking](#networking)

This time, we will explore challenges that most of leaders (both technical and organisational) stumble upon during their daily work. Challenges that impact everyone’s productivity and bring about a certain amount of discomfort.

Join us and discover how to manage change even if you don’t agree, and how to deal with information overflow and context switching that drains your focus and mental capabilities.

### Managing Change. Especially the one you don’t agree with
#### Abstract
Change is unavoidable in most companies, and the art of managing it effectively is a key competence for every leader or any senior engineer. In a rapidly changing environment it becomes even more important. Proper change management can determine whether an initiative will be a success for the organization or another tough lesson.

But what happens when the change is something you don’t agree with?
Industry literature shows the rules that should be followed in order to achieve a company's goals without compromising business relationships and one’s authority. These basic rules are simple, but not easy to implement.

In this talk, I will present a couple of real-life cases where applying them yielded great results for my team’s work and environment.

### Can I interrupt you for a second?

#### Abstract

Context switching and multitasking - everyone knows these monsters lurking around the corner. Everyone's heard how terrifying these beasts are, hiding in the corporate closet... Or is it just an urban legend?

In a flood of information available at our fingertips - on our phones, wrists, and countless other screens - has our brain already adapted to function in multitasking mode? Is context switching really still such a burden on our minds? And, by the way, what exactly is context switching?

In my presentation, I’ll invite you to join me in a corporate colosseum where we face epic daily battles: the battles for priorities and our focus.
